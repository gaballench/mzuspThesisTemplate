@article{Kolenc2006,
abstract = {Although Physalaemus frogs are prominent members of Neotropical herpetofauna, larval stages are $\backslash$nnot known from more than half of the species in this genus. Herein, we describe the tadpole of $\backslash$nPhysalaemus henselii based on samples collected in Departamento de Rivera, northern Uruguay. $\backslash$nGeneral aspect and major external morphological features are similar to most of other known $\backslash$ntadpoles of Physalaemus. Remarkable character states are a medial vent tube and the presence of $\backslash$ndorsal and ventral gaps in the row of marginal oral papillae. Physalaemus henselii has been $\backslash$nsuccessively assigned to the P. cuvieri and to the P. henselii species groups, but no conclusions can $\backslash$nbe drawn in support of these associations from external larval morphology. Instead, we found that $\backslash$nsome character states may contribute to relate species, like the presence of a ventral gap in the $\backslash$nmarginal row of oral papillae which is shared by P. albonotatus, P. cuqui, P. cuvieri, P. fernandezae $\backslash$nand P. henselii. This character state is unique among non-bufonid anurans, although it is also $\backslash$npresent in some species of the related genus Pseudopaludicola. In addition, P. albonotatus, P. cuqui $\backslash$nand P. cuvieri tadpoles can be differentiated from P. fernandezae and P. henselii by the presence of $\backslash$ntwo small ventrolateral gaps, which are absent in the latter.},

abstract = {The external morphology and internal oral features of Physalaemus fuscomaculatus (Steindachner, 1864) tadpoles are described and compared with other species in the Physalalemus biligonigerus group (Lynch, 1970). Tadpoles of P. fuscomaculatus have a morphology similar to other species within this group and closely resemble those of P. santafecinus Barrio, 1965 and P. biligonigerus (Cope, 1861). The tadpole of P. fuscomaculatus differs from those of the biligonigerus group by the following characters: i) proportionally shorter tail compared to total length, ii) presence of two narrow ventral gaps on marginal papillae of the oral disc; iii) upper jaw sheath M- shaped; iv) presence of two lingual papillae; v) two to three prepocket papillae, and vi) three to five pustulations anterior to each buccal pocket. This is the first record of Physalaemus fuscomaculatus in southeastern Brazil.},

abstract = {An analysis of specimens deposited in herpetological collections and identified as Physalaemus fuscomaculatus demonstrated that these differ from the types of this taxon, Eupemphix fuscomaculatus. Consequently, the taxonomic status of Gomphobates marmoratus and Eupemphix fuscomaculatus was revised based on the types and on data in the literature. Gomphobates marmoratus is associated to the genus Physalaemus, as Physalaemus marmoratus, and refers to specimens previously identified as Physalaemus fuscomaculatus. Additionally, Eupemphix fuscomaculatus is associated to the genus Pleurodema in the combination Pleurodema fuscomaculata.},
